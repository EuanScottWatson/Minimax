# Minimax
Very simple, install the required modules then just run the program and a GUI should appear. <br>
You play first and play as 'X'. Click the square you wish to put your piece. <br>
At any point, press `Esc` to quit or `r` to restart the game. <br>
If I did my job, you should always lose or draw :)
